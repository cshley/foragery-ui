# foragery

foragery is a web application designed to catalog edible and medicinal plants that can be grown in home gardens. 

As a passionate gardener with an interest in natural remedies and sustainable growing, I wanted to create an easy-to-use and accessible tool to explore plant uses, growing techniques, and benefits.

This project is both a personal learning journey and a resource for others who share an interest in foraging, herbalism, and home gardening. 

Whether you're looking for new plants to grow or simply want to expand your knowledge, foragery provides a structured way to discover and explore useful plants.
