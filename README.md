# foragery

## About

foragery is a web application designed to catalog edible and medicinal plants that can be grown in home gardens.

As a passionate gardener with an interest in natural remedies and sustainable growing, I wanted to create an easy-to-use and accessible tool to explore plant uses, growing techniques, and benefits.

This project is both a personal learning journey and a resource for others who share an interest in edible plants, herbalism, and home gardening.

Whether you're looking for new plants to grow or simply want to expand your knowledge, foragery provides a structured way to discover and explore useful plants.
